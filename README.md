IT 325 – Web Application Development
Project #2
“Amazon Wanna-Be”
 
 
Problem Description:
After the success of your previous app, your boss is wowed by just how well it went over with the company.  He tells you his next great idea for an internal company app: start a quadcopter store.  He says the idea is to allow employees to bring quadcopters up to the office, as well as get the company to buy quadcopters every month, and then this new app facilitates the sharing.  He tells you that this quadcopter store has to be "modern" and needs to be "up to standards...whatever that means."  With that, he sends you out of his office.
 
 
The Assignment:
Your project must include the following:
User login (feel free to take this code from your previous project)
After login, it takes the user to a front page where they can see:
Latest quadcopter
Quadcopter categories
A link to their shopping cart
Click on each quadcopter to go to a page that shows this particular quadcopter's information.
Your app will read into the database a file of unknown length that contains quadcopters, provided by the instructor in this format:
[SKU], [Model], [Vendor], [Type], [Description];
Shopping cart:
Users should be able to drag quadcopters from the page into their shopping cart.
Use HTML5 and JavaScript for the dragging.
Use AJAX for updating the users cart in the database.
Users should be able to rate quadcopters, write reviews, and create a wish-list.
 
 
Technical Requirements:
Your entire project must use HTML5.
All pages must utilize CSS to make it look good.  Poor design will cause points to be lost.
Poor coding practices will cause points to be lost.
You may use libraries like jquery.  You may NOT use frameworks.
 
 
You must work in groups of 2.
 
 
Your group must turn in the following:
Your code folder in a zip format
A link to your website (the server you were given)
A statement saying what each team member did to contribute to this project.
The deadline is class time on the due date.  Late work will be accepted, losing 1 letter grade per day it is late.
